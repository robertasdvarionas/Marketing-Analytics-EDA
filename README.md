## GOAL

The goal of this project is to apply data analysis tools - **SQL and Power BI** - to the dataset and then to gather insights and tendencies from it.

## DATA OVERVIEW

This dataset is taken from Kaggle and is publicly available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test). It can be utilized for EDA, Statistical Analysis, and Visualizations.

The dataset *ifood_df.csv* consists of 2206 customers of XYZ company with data on:

* Customer profiles
* Product preferences
* Campaign successes/failures
* Channel performance

I do not own this dataset. I am simply making it accessible on this platform via the public GitHub [link](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test).
